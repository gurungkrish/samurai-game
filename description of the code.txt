Project title: ‘The Samurai” game
Game’s mechanics:
This is an action game. We have two attacks light and heavy attack.
1 is for light attack while 2 is for heavy attack.
I have introduced a concept of deflection to make stuff interesting. Advance enemies will be able to randomly deflect your attacks which means u will not be causing them any damage but will be getting damaged instead.
For deflection: 
You’ll have to guess which attack the enemy is going to make. Bosses will always have more than 2 attacks so you’ll have to guess between 1,2 and 3 if you guess the correct number you will remain unfazed.
Modes:
I have made 2 modes in the game:
-classic mode
-quick mode
In classic mode, I have set out 3 bosses to fight with different difficulties (each having their specialties).
As the game proceeds opponents are going to be tougher.
In quick mode,
You’ll be able to choose who you‘ll fight with.
You will be given  4options:
To play with boss1 2 or 3 or computer will choose a random boss from them.
Welcome screen:
You’ll see a logo at first which is a text art which I’ve used by reading from the file
Stats and each power enemy posses is being shown by excell
At the end you’ll be given a screen to continue playing again or just leave.
